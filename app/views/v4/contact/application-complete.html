        What we need
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Before we can process your claim we will need a copy of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the funeral bill or signed contract between you and the funeral director</li>
        <li>any final statements from the accounts of the person who died</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you do not have a bill or signed contract, we will contact the funeral director for a copy after the funeral. If you can get a copy from your funeral director, or ask them to send it to us, we may be able to process your claim faster.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will also need to contact you about any life insurance policies for the person who died. </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How to send it
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can send us what we need by email or post.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll need to include your full name, address and National Insurance number with anything you send, so we can match it to your claim.
