      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Before we can process your claim:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we need a copy of the signed contract</li>
        <li>we need a copy of any final statements from the accounts of the person who died</li>
        <!-- <li>we will contact you about any life insurance policies</li> -->
      </ul>
      <!-- <p>
        If you do not have a bill or signed contract, we will contact the funeral director for a copy after the funeral. If you can get a copy from your funeral director, or ask them to send it to us, we may be able to process your claim faster.
      </p> -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
